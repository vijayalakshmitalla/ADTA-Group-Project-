## Report Overview

This report delivers actionable insights on factors influencing rental prices, including property features and lot size. Analyses cover:

- Descriptive statistics and data cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (scatter plots, histograms, bar charts, box plots)
- One-way and two-way ANOVA (with and without interaction)
- Simple and multiple regression models
- Discussion of findings and investment recommendations


## Methodology

- Collect and clean Denton County real-estate data
- Summarize using descriptive statistics
- Visualize relationships via scatter plots, histograms, bar charts, and box plots
- Test research hypotheses with one-way and two-way ANOVA
- Build linear models to quantify effects of living area, amenities, garage spaces, bedrooms, bathrooms, and lot size
- Evaluate model assumptions and refine via backward elimination


## Research Questions

- How do extra bedrooms affect rental price?
- What impact do garage spaces and property age have on price?
- Do fireplaces and pools significantly influence rental rates?
- How does living area correlate with rental price?
- Which amenities drive rental value most strongly?
- What is the effect of lot size on rental price?


## Key Findings

- **Bedrooms:** Significant effect on rental price (One-way ANOVA)
- **Garage Spaces:** Positive impact; **Age:** no significant effect (Two-way ANOVA without interaction)
- **Fireplaces:** Significant; **Pools:** no significant effect; no significant interaction (Two-way ANOVA with interaction)
- **Living Area:** Each additional sq ft increases rent by ≈\$88 (Simple regression)
- **Amenities Model:** Living area, bathrooms, bedrooms, garage spaces jointly explain ~60% of price variation (Multiple regression)
- **Lot Size:** Positive linear relationship with rent; each extra acre adds ≈\$13,583 (Simple regression)
